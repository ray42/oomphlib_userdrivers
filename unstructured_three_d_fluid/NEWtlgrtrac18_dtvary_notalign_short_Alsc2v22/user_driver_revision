    David's correction to various triangle based integration schemes
    which had a factor of 1/2 missing in the weights.... Also moved
    instantiations of some MG fcts (which used to live in
    src/generic/geometric_multigrid.h and were therefore potentially
    built repeatedly, causing confusion at linking time, into a separate
    cc file.
